 - Install composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

 - Create a MySQL database for the project.

 - Create a file called .env:
```

    'NOTIFICATION_EMAIL' = 'emailaddress'
```
Replace with your connection info.

 - From the project directory,
   1. `composer install`

      That will download dependencies.

   2. `php artisan key:generate`

      That will Publish vendor dependencies.

   3. `php artisan migrate`
